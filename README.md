# Detection of Anomalous Vehicles Using Physics of Traffic

This repository contains the appendix of the paper "Detection of Anomalous Vehicles Using Physics of Traffic". It contains the complete set of results generated with different percentages (i.e. 10%, 20% and 40%) of anomalous nodes for different traffic scenarios with both localised and globalised ground truth.
