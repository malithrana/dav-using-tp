# Detection of Anomalous Vehicles Using Physics of Traffic

This repository contains the appendix of the paper "Detection of Anomalous Vehicles Using Physics of Traffic" and the simulation data used for the experiments. 

The appendix contains the complete set of results generated with different percentages (i.e. 10%, 20% and 40%) of anomalous nodes for different traffic scenarios with both localised and globalised ground truth.

The data contain the simulated traffic networks (i.e. the schematic network and Sydney M4) used their trajectory outputs.
